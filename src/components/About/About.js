            <p>Terrat Design is a small but capable boutique design firm. 
                
With over 20 years of interior design experience, our projects are as unique as our many clients. We ask, listen and deliver personalized interiors that suit a wide range of aesthetic and practical requirements. Never cookie-cutter, always personalized and appropriate.  

As just a two person firm, we only take on a handful of projects so we can focus intensely on our clients needs and goals. We work with a talented team of craftspeople, vendors & trades and manage all the phases of a project from initial inspiration to the final installation. 

Our goal is to deliver spaces our clients will love looking at, and living in, for years to come.
