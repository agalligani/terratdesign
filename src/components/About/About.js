            <p><b>Terrat Design</b> is a small but capable boutique design firm.</p>

<p>With over 20 years of interior design experience, our projects are as unique as our many clients. We ask, listen and deliver personalized interiors that suit a wide range of aesthetic and practical requirements. Never cookie-cutter, always personalized and appropriate.</p>

<p>As just a two person firm, we only take on a handful of projects so we can focus intensely on our clients needs and goals. We work with a talented team of craftspeople, vendors & trades and manage all the phases of a project from initial inspiration to the final installation.</p>

<p>Our goal is to deliver spaces our clients will love looking at, and living in, for years to come.</p>
